Agriculture plays a critical role in the economy of every country. Farmers grow a variety of crops every year. One of the primary considerations answerable for the harvest devastation and not having appropriate development of the crops is infections and diseases. This model uses deep learning and image processing to detect plant diseases and recommend corresponding organic solutions to treat the plants using convolutional neural networks, which play a crucial role in visual imagery. 

TensorFlow is used to extract some of the libraries and image processing. Keras is also used to predict feature extraction and fine-tune hyperparameters This model also recommends the appropriate Organic solutions such as manure, Vermicompost, Bonemeal e, etc. based on the type of plant and disease. Moreover, the model has a feature identifying pests and recommends organic remedies such as essential oils, cow dung, and neem paste to protect the crop from damage. 

The objective is to deliver a user-friendly interface for farmers to grow their plantâ€™s organ organically. This model aims to find the best solution for delivering the most accurate Deep Learning. Model for Plant Disease Prediction and Organic Solutions.

An SQL database contains the solutions for the respective diseases.
